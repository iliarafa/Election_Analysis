# **Election_Audit**

### Overview of project

This analysis aims to answer three additional questions put forth by the election commission 
following the initial election audit results. The commission has requested values for voter turnout and 
total vote percentage per county, as well as an answer as to which county had the highest turnout. 

## Audit Results

- A total of 369,711 were cast.

- **Denver** had the largest number of votes with 306,055 which accounts for 82.8% of total vote.

- Jefferson followed with 38,855 votes, or 10.5% of total votes while Arapahoe counted 24,801 votes
  which is equal to 6.7% of total vote. 
  
- The winning candidate was **Diana DeGette**, who secured 73.8% of total vote with 272,892 votes.

- Second to the finish line was Charles Casper Stockham, earning 85,213 votes for 23.0% of the total vote
  followed in the distance by Raymon Anthony Doane who received 11,606 votes and 3.1% of total vote. 
  
### Summary
  
The script worked well in our analysis. We were dealing with a small number of candidates and a small 
number of counties, but our script is already built to work in larger scale elections. What we could work on is deeper specifics. 
We could modify our script to include more parameters like age and gender
or any other demographic value. These would help the election commission interpret the result in greater depths. 
Another important tool would be provided to us if we modified the code further to compare election results
with the last election. This would give the commission an insight on voter movement between the isles
and other qualitative information.
